# Development Process

Water rights are being attached to the associated distribution system on the Water Right Network. The workflow to accomplish this is broadly as follows:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Identify the water right

Research the water right, investigate the place of use, and associated canal or conveyance system
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Digitize the place of use&#x20;

Digitize the legal 'Place of Use' polygon if not already done
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Draw the depletion area

Generate the service area polygon
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Create a field node

Create a field node in the middle of the service area and attach it to the service area polygon
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Create a diversion&#x20;

Create the diversion from the water source and draw the distribution works&#x20;
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Path attributes&#x20;

Attribute the water right and associate it with the distribution path
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add the water measurement station&#x20;

Address the DVRT station for the conveyance to the flowline if applicable water rights that will be added onto the network currently are based on the following questions:&#x20;

1. Can the diversion be seen?&#x20;
2. Can the place of use be seen?&#x20;
3. Can the flow path to the place of use be understood?
4. Can the water rights used be identified?
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
