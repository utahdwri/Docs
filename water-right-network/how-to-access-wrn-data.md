**Disclaimer**&#x20;

* The WRN is under development by the Water Right Network Team and therefore is subject to change.&#x20;
* The WRN in this does not constitute legal water right description
* The scope of the Water Right Network is currently limited geographically to the Upper Colorado River and the Great Salt Lake Basin. Additionally, most areas are limited to portray solely surface water diversions and irrigation uses.
* The WRN Areas are often named either by the Distribution System they represent or the most relevant hydrologic or geographic feature. For example, Heber City is in the 'Provo River' WRN Area because it is located in the Distribution System of the same name. Loa, which is not within a Distribution System, is in the 'Upper Fremont' WRN Area because it is located along the upper portion of the Fremont River. The map also has a search feature to find exact addresses.
