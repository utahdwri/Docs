# Water Right Network

> _The Utah Water Right Network (WRN) is a geospatial dataset managed by the Utah Division of Water Rights (DWRi), an agency within the Department of Natural Resources, to regulate and distribute the state's water resources. The WRN was launched in March 2022. Its purpose is to integrate statewide hydrologic and administrative data, including accounting models, into a single framework. This approach supports internal management and improves transparency. The importance of the WRN was affirmed by the 2023 Legislative Audit, which recommended continued development._<br>

**Disclaimer**&#x20;

* The WRN is under development by the Water Right Network Team and therefore is subject to change.&#x20;
* The WRN in this does not constitute legal water right description
* The scope of the Water Right Network is currently limited geographically to the Upper Colorado River and the Great Salt Lake Basin. Additionally, most areas are limited to portray solely surface water diversions and irrigation uses.
* The WRN Areas are often named either by the Distribution System they represent or the most relevant hydrologic or geographic feature. For example, Heber City is in the 'Provo River' WRN Area because it is located in the Distribution System of the same name. Loa, which is not within a Distribution System, is in the 'Upper Fremont' WRN Area because it is located along the upper portion of the Fremont River. The map also has a search feature to find exact addresses.

### What is the Water Right Network (WRN)?

The Intent of the Water Right Network (WRN) is to be an easily available central data repository housing statewide hydrologic data including hydrography, water right information, diversion records, streamflow records, and accounting models. The WRN data can be found through the [Division of Water Rights (DWRi) map database](https://waterrights.utah.gov/gisinfo/maps/default.asp) and directly at this [link](https://maps.waterrights.utah.gov/EsriMap/map.asp?layersToAdd=network).

### **Why the WRN?**

One of the immediate needs of the Water Right Network is to obtain an accurate depletion accounting to assist with Colorado River Compact negotiations and other basin issues.

The Division of Water Rights also has a need to digitize water usage for increased accountability and transparency as noted by the legislative performance audit report no. 2023-15 reg. This allows for improved transparency not only for those involved in water use, planning, but also the public.

For more information regarding the legislative audit, see: [Utah’s Water Management Report No. 2023‐15, Report to the UTAH LEGISLATURE, A Performance Audit of Ensuring Data Integrity, Program Best Practices, and Comprehensive Water Planning](https://le.utah.gov/interim/2024/pdf/00001105.pdf)



### [Teams](https://utah-division-of-water-rights.gitbook.io/dataservices/about/staff#water-right-network-team)

Our team consists of 2 subteams, one focused on the Colorado River and its tributaries, the other focused on the Great Salt Lake Basin. These teams both focus on mapping water rights use, diversion, measurement, and diversion accounting. We have an engineer to help with depletion accounting, modeling efforts, and supporting the team with training and outreach. The Water Right Network Manager supports the team with long-term goals, coordinating with outside data users, and other senior engineer level issues. The Water Right Network is being developed to support diversion accounting with WCAT models, Technical Services' General Solver, and will be considered in the development of HydroServer. Our team’s focus is on diversion and depletion accounting, but the WRN can be used by many other sections within Water Rights.
