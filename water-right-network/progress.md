# Progress

### Colorado River Basin

In the Colorado River Basin, Water Right Network development is complete for 20 of 37 areas, and the team made 136 field visits with water users to gather complete information.  The team has also initiated its first depletion-accounting report for the Duchesne–Strawberry Distribution System, and is actively building three additional areas. The completion of the entire basin is expected by June 2026.

### &#x20;Great Salt Lake Basin

With new funding, the Section also established the Great Salt Lake Basin (GSLB) Water Right Network in July 2025, to strengthen water-distribution oversight, improve water-accounting capabilities, and help Utah meet its interstate compact obligations. A priority work plan was developed for all 23 WRN areas in the Basin. The team has conducted 11 field visits with water users to learn about water use infrastructure and get feedback on the developed network in their area. Completion of the GSLB WRN is expected to take two to three years, with an anticipated completion date of December 2027.

### Metrics and Statistics

The WRN team is working on producing the following metrics that communicate different aspects of the WRN components and their development progress.&#x20;

What’s the total permitted flow and volume of these rights? We want to communicate the fraction of water rights that have measurements and the significance of their permitted flow or volume. This could be an objective metric to inform the prioritization of installing new measurements</td><td>To be evaluated</td></tr></tbody></table>
