# Action Plan

### Long Term Vision

The Division of Water Rights is the institutional memory of water data for the state. However, the use and understanding of water right information and data is needed beyond internal use. It is more imperative than ever for the division to improve operations, efficiency, measurement, and data management. Because of the growing need for water rights data by multiple agencies, the Data Services Section of the Division of Water Rights was created. The Water Right Network Team is housed in this section. Our goal is to create an action plan that will guide daily operations and improve data sharing. The purpose of the Water Right Network Action Plan is to build on the Division of Water Rights’ Action Plan, then to set direction further, prioritize tasks, identify resource needs and benchmark progress with conscientious accountability.

The Intent of the Water Right Network is to be an easily available central data repository housing statewide hydrologic data including hydrography, water right information, diversion records, streamflow records, and accounting models.

\
Standardized distribution accounting practices will make these models transparent and understandable. The goal is that all distribution systems operate accounting models that are built and maintained according to best practices. These models are the authoritative source for distribution and accounting information in the State. Tools within the Water Right Network will automate and expose distribution accounting processes and illustrate how much water was diverted under each right. These accounting models are the first step in an annual statewide depletion report that shows depletion by water right, beginning with the Upper Colorado River Basin.

\
If the Water Right Network is to be the future of water right administration in the State then it must be more than a snapshot in time. Maintenance and upkeep of the Network will be integrated into the daily work flows of Division staff. The Water Right Network team will lead out in providing standards and training for how this can be accomplished. In the future the team will be a resource to all division staff in how to interact with the Network.

### Objective 1: Building the Water Right Network

\
The Water Right Network (WRN) is the interface where four different data sets that already exist on the Division website are connected in a meaningful way. These data sets are 1. Water right information. 2. Hydrography. 4. Diversion and streamflow records. 5. Accounting database. Some basic information about these five data sets are provided below.

\
Water right information: The Water Rights Database is a user-friendly representation of the most recent form of a water right. From this interface you can access the foundational documents associated with a water right which are the source of truth when it comes to the limits of a right. The WRN provides hyperlinks to the Water Right Database home page of each water right number that has been entered into the WRN so that every user of the WRN can easily reference these source documents.

\
Hydrography: Maps are one of the many documents housed, and even made, by the Division. These maps often depict the path of conveyance systems such as ditches and canals. WRN staff take time to look internally and externally for the most recent information concerning ditch and canal alignments. Once the most recent accessible information is determined, team members recreate this hydrography in the WRN so that the physical extent of these conveyance systems can be understood.

\
Diversion and stream flow records: The Division has housed diversion and stream flow records for many years. Currently the Division is doing this for thousands of locations across the state. Some of these locations are maintained by the Division but most are owned and maintained by the Division's many partners such as water conservancy districts, irrigation companies, and USGS. WRN staff make connections between the WRN and these records so that anyone looking at a particular ditch or canal on the WRN would be able to see a hyperlink from the WRN to the measurement record location housed in the Division website.



Distribution accounting models: It is the statutory authority of the State Engineer's Office to distribute waters of the state. One of the ways this is accomplished is through distribution accounting models. These models determine the natural flow available on a system and account for the water diverted in priority by each right. This is a critical step that must take place before a per water right depletion report can be generated by the WRN on a system.

\
The WRN team are the assigned staff to make the connections between these four different data sets by adhering to team standards. Developed work flow paths are followed to ensure the goals of the team are met in a timely manner. These connections tell the story of how the water actually moves on the system by illustrating where it is diverted, under which rights was it diverted, how much was diverted, how it was transported after it was diverted, and where it was used.



The intent of the WRN is that it will be an interface that shows actual water use across the state. However, the current focus of the team is in Utah’s Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) and in the Great Salt Lake Basin (GSLB). By the end of fiscal year 2026 the WRN team will have the Network built out in the entirety of Utah’s UCRB. This will allow the team to move into other water basins in the state. The WRN team started work in the GSLB at the beginning of FY2026.

\
Deliverable FY25: WRN built out on Duchesne-Strawberry, Lake Fork-Yellowstone, Uinta-Whiterocks, Deep Creek, Ashley, Price, Huntington, Cottonwood, Ferron, Muddy, and City of Green River systems.

\
Deliverables FY26: WRN built in remainder of Utah’s UCRB.

WRN built out on the Goshen/Nephi, Provo River, Spanish Fork River, Hobble Creek, Lower Jordan River, Utah Lake/Jordan River, and Little Cottonwood systems.&#x20;

{% tab title="2: Building WCAT Models" %}
### Objective 2: Building WCAT Models



Water Commissioner Accounting Tool (WCAT) is the current method used by the Division to perform distribution accounting on a river system. Although many of these models currently exist throughout the state the organization and reports produced by these already developed models has been inconsistent. Furthermore, it should be understood that WCAT development is not the primary responsibility of the WRN team. It should also be considered that one purpose of the WRN is to become the catalyst for the General Solver to perform distribution accounting.

\
That being said, the WRN team does have to become intimately familiar with water distribution practices on each river system they encounter. Additionally, the WRN team has more resources than the teams dedicated to modeling. At this stage the General Solver is still in a development and testing phase. It would therefore seem prudent that some of the work time put in by select WRN team members should go into the development of WCAT on select systems.

\
In order for this to happen technical services, field services, and data services need to agree on standards for modeling and several other items. Modeling methods, key features of each model, and who approves each model are just a few issues to consider. If consensus can be reached and standards written on these and other concerns it would allow the efforts of the WRN team that are put into distribution modeling to have a greater and quicker effect.

\
In order to connect the WRN to accounting models these models must exist. In order to do depletion accounting per water right we must first understand the diversion per water right which is what the models accomplish. With this understanding the WRN team will follow the Modeling Action Plan and coordinate with the modeling team to build WCAT’s on the Duchesne-Strawberry, Ashley, Deep Creek, and Brush Creek river systems by the end of fiscal year 2026.



Deliverable FY25: Duchesne-Strawberry, Ashley, and Deep Creek models 75% complete.



Deliverable FY26: Duchesne-Strawberry, Ashley, Deep Creek, and Brush Creek models complete. Cottonwood Creek model updated to current standards.



Deliverable FY27: Transition to using the General Apportionment Solver for distribution accounting.

{% tab title="3: Depletion Accounting" %}
### Objective 3: Depletion Accounting

\
The Division of Water Resources has been providing state wide depletion reports for many years. Climatic conditions across the west have become such that this high level reporting is no longer adequate and a more granular approach is necessary. The Division of Water Rights is the state agency who has legislative authority to determine the diversion and depletion allowed per water right and the agency who has the statutory authority to collect and report actual measurement of diversion and depletion.

\
The WRN is the tool that provides an illustrated interpretation of the legal record and what is actually taking place on the ground. When these two things are stitched together a true understanding can take place of how much water was diverted and depleted under each right.

\
Once it is understood where the water is being diverted the next question that must be asked is where is it being used. The WRN again takes the legal record and what is actually taking place on the ground to create service areas that show where a collection of water rights could be potentially put to use.

\
After this service area has been created, that contains assigned water rights, data sets created by other entities can be used to determine how much depletion has taken place in that service area.

\
This is accomplished by overlaying the Water Related Land Use data set created and maintained by the Division of Water Resources over the WRN service areas. Remote sensed depletion data created by OpenET can then be reviewed at the intersection of the service area and water related land use to determine how much depletion took place in a given water year.



After effective precipitation has been backed out of the depletion number for the service area the estimated total depletion for the irrigation season in the service area would be arrived at. Once this number is known it can be apportioned according to the water rights that were used to divert the water.



This concept is a key component to the creation of the WRN. By the end of fiscal year 2026 the WRN team will provide a proof of concept of how depletion accounting can take place on a per water right basis on the Duchesne-Strawberry River System.

{% tab title="4: Integration of Water Right Network" %}
### Objective 4: Integration of Water Right Network

\
Across the state monumental efforts are being put forth by the WRN team to understand how water deliveries are being made on river systems today. However, practices change, new demands arise, and greater clarity comes with time. If the WRN is to be a living thing that retains its purpose of showing actual water use today it will have to be maintained into the future.



The WRN team has developed an [outreach and training program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ynapRrpa7dkUyqd9_BZJgOntJRJPQu2ESScst9cKVbo/edit?tab=t.0) to help Division staff understand what the WRN is and how to interface with it. This plan will make clear what tasks each region or section should begin implementing into their daily work flows. Just as importantly it will make clear which function of the WRN the regions and sections should not concern themselves with.

\
This plan will detail how and when training will take place for Division staff. It will also determine which members of the WRN team should be sought out by each region and section if/when they have questions or concerns. The plan will contain references to applicable WRN team standards especially when it comes to mapping, hydrography, and legal record corrections.

\
A portion of the plan will cover how to partner with technical services on the development and implementation of Water Use Groups version 3 (WUG3). This section will primarily focus on outreach to aid in the development of WUG3 and then joint training efforts about the WRN and WUG3 once WUG3 is developed and ready for implementation. See the [WUG3 Action Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DoFw_k30p16yqRCuwSYVMIkDvKVN4y5nqnRnPK3Hn0A/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.y6dvr5xuzax0) for more details.

\
**Deliverable FY25**: Develop and have approved the Water Right Network Division Outreach and Training Plan.

\
**Deliverable FY26**: Implement plan in regions where WRN is built out and any applicable sections.

\
**Deliverable FY27**: Implement plan for training external agencies and organizations.
