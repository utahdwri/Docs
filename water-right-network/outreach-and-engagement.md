# Outreach and Engagement

The Water Right Network (WRN) team developed an Outreach and Training Plan that outlines a structured approach to building internal capacity and external awareness to support the long-term maintenance, accuracy, and use of the WRN. The plan distinguishes between network stewards—internal users such as regional offices, adjudication teams, and general users, including state agencies, NGOs, and the public who access WRN data for transparency, research, and planning. Training is prioritized by role and delivered through a mix of WRN coordinator training, annual process training, one-on-one mentoring, and general awareness presentations, with an emphasis on establishing WRN coordinators in regional offices to ensure two-way communication and consistent standards. Training is aligned with the phased build-out of the WRN by basin, beginning with the Colorado River Basin and expanding through the Great Salt Lake Basin, ensuring staff are trained as the network becomes active in their regions and supporting broader adoption, inter-agency data sharing, and public understanding of Utah’s water rights system.\
\
The WRN team engaged many of the  regional engineers, distribution engineers, and adjudication staff in the development of this plan. These conversations helped guide the level of interaction with the WRN team for each of the respective sections within the Division of Water Rights. One large success from the discussions was the idea of WRN coordinators to provide two-way communication between the WRN team and regional offices. This allows updated standards to be communicated efficiently and resolves issues the regional offices experience in a timely manner.

## Outreach and Training Objectives&#x20;

Outreach will be focused on two user categories; network stewards and general users. Stewards will generally be actively editing within the network and require in-depth knowledge of the processes of the WRN. These users will also require permissions to be set up and continuing support after initial training. General users will be given broad stroke information to use the WRN for different purposes.

### 1. Network Stewards&#x20;

Network stewards will generally be using all editing functions to adjust WRN elements as necessary to reflect current conditions. The users will have access to all the same permissions as the WRN team as determined necessary by the WRN manager.&#x20;

Other Division staff will view the network and verify accurate information is currently reflected.  If something is inaccurately reflected then a request for assistance can be made directly to the WRN team via email to the WRN manager.&#x20;



1. **Regional Office Teams**\
   The role of regional offices will be a key communication point with water users for updated information. During in-person or phone conversations the regional offices will be able to verify changes to water use and update them on the WRN. Additionally, updates can be made during the draft certificate process. This audience will be a high priority. &#x20;
2. **Adjudication Teams**\
   Adjudication teams are currently mapping conveyance going forward using ArcGIS Survey123. When the proposed determination is published, the WRN team can upload adjudications’ GIS information located within their file and make necessary updates to the network. This process is still in development and will be documented in the future.&#x20;
3. **Distribution Engineers**\
   Distribution Engineers will be key in verifying measurement station related network elements added by the WRN team. As part of this they will need to have an understanding of the WRN scope for applicability. The WRN team will build the network and the distribution engineers will have the choice to make changes or request any changes via email to the WRN manager. If the distribution engineers make changes to the network then they will notify the WRN manager to ensure that it was added to the current standards.  If the WRN team makes the changes then the WRN team will reach out to the distribution engineer for confirmation that the adjustments were made correctly.&#x20;



### 2. General Users

General users will be able to only view, interact with, and download the public facing elements of the WRN network. These users will not be given any access or permissions for editing. General users will be given training to use basic navigation functions and contextual information. General users may request the WRN team for additional data or training  on a case by case basis to support studies and research.&#x20;

\
General Users

1. **State Divisions and Agencies**\
   Other state entities could benefit from data contained on the water right network. This audience will be a medium priority for training purposes and would be done on case by case requests.&#x20;
2. **Non-Government Organizations** \
   Non-governmental organizations will be focused on data for water related advocacy and research. Training presentations will provide basic understanding of the WRN. This audience will be low priority for training purposes and be done on a case by case request.
3. **General Public, consultants, and researchers** \
   The general public will be focused on public awareness of water use. Training presentations will provide basic understanding of the WRN. This audience will be low priority for training purposes and be done on case by case requests.&#x20;

{% tab title="Training Content " %}
## Training Content&#x20;

Training content will be done in the order of priority, which corresponds with the descending order shown in the table. Training will vary from detailed presentations with mentoring sessions following, or general awareness training with basic WRN principles presented.&#x20;

### &#x20;Regional WRN Coordinator Training&#x20;

This includes a pre-recorded and self-paced training that takes approximately half a day to complete. There is a focus on giving direct network examples, context, and building competency in the WRN process. The objective is to add WRN competent individuals to each regional office that can act as a local subject matter expert on WRN tasks. This training will be emailed to them when selected to be a WRN coordinator. Equally these individuals will participate in monthly meetings with the WRN team to get updates and additional process updates. &#x20;

### WRN Annual Process Training&#x20;

This training includes a one hour in depth presentation that goes over polygon editing, node creation, adding water rights, and other WRN processes. The Water Right Network Guide is provided with the instruction to read the basic section prior to the training and serves as an instructional desk guide after.&#x20;

### One-on-One Mentoring

This will be an optional one-on-one mentoring for their first network related tasks. This mentoring would include coaching through the tasks while giving context and constructive feedback on best practices.&#x20;

### General Awareness Training&#x20;

This training will be to give basic understanding of how to view the WRN layers on the online GIS map and navigate through the information available. A focus will also be placed on the context of how the network was built out to ensure that users understand the purpose and objectives of the WRN.&#x20;

{% tab title="Timelines" %}
## WRN Training Delivery Timelines

### Great Salt Lake Basin&#x20;

The Great Salt Lake Basin is currently beginning its efforts by hiring the team and planning initial work areas. Hiring for team members occurred in August of FY 26. The areas of Upper Bear River, Lower Bear River, Logan River, and Summit Creek were identified for build-out first. These initial areas are expected to be completed tentatively at the end of FY 26. Areas of the Weber River, Ogden River, Lower Jordan, and Utah Lake/Jordan River system are expected to be completed subsequently around the end of FY 27.&#x20;

No training for staff in the Great Salt Lake Basin has occurred and will be done as the WRN team enters the regional office’s area. This is done to increase the regional office’s staff of our presence in their region with water users meetings and give information about the team's efforts in the event they receive questions from the public.&#x20;

The Great Salt Lake Basin Coordinators will be brought on as the WRN team enters the regional offices area.

### Colorado River Basin &#x20;

The Colorado river basin is already in-progress with completion of its network elements and is expected prior to FY 27.&#x20;

The Colorado River Basin WRN Coordinators will be selected from the Vernal and Price regional offices upon approval of this document. Further coordinators will be brought on as the WRN team enters the regional office’s area.&#x20;
