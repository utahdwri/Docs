# Internal Data Audit

For over a century, the Utah Division of Water Rights (DWRi) has collected detailed records of water use and distribution that are published annually in Commissioner Reports. However, a recent legislative audit highlighted the need to modernize these records to ensure accuracy, consistency, and accessibility. A small team was assembled to hand-enter and review historical water measurement data contained in the DWRi database (DVRT). This project aims to enhance the quality of information accessible to the public and decision-makers by addressing existing data gaps.

\
**In the long run, this work will allow for:**

* Better Decision-Making: Reliable water data helps state officials, local communities, and researchers make informed decisions about water use, conservation, and planning.
* Increased Transparency: By making historical and current water data more accessible, the project supports public understanding and trust in how water is managed.
* Preserving History: Hand entering records that are missing from DVRT ensures that valuable information—some dating back over 100 years—is preserved for future generations and can be used to analyze trends and changes over time.
* Supporting Innovation: Improved data systems enable the use of modern tools and technologies, such as dashboards and modeling, to manage water more effectively.



Reviewing and entering data from Commissioner Reports for several distribution systems has revealed some challenges:

* **Missing or Damaged Records**: Some historical reports are missing or have become illegible over time, making it difficult to create a complete record.
* **Inconsistent Formats:** Reports from different regions and eras often use different formats, requiring extra effort to standardize and interpret the data.
* **Name Changes**: Diversions and distribution systems have changed names over the years, adding complexity to tracking and comparing data.
* Technical Limitations: The DVRT database does not support advanced features like version control or outlier tracking, which are needed for high-quality data management.

Despite these challenges, the DVRT Review Project is making significant progress. By working together, we are building a stronger foundation for Utah’s water future—one that is transparent, reliable, and ready to meet the needs of our state for years to come.
