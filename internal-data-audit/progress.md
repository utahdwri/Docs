# Progress

The Team undertook a comprehensive effort to digitize and review historical water distribution data across all 43 distribution systems. This initiative involved scanning Annual Commissioner Reports (CR) from 1983 to 2024, manually entering daily, monthly, and annual measurements into the Division’s Water Measurement database (DVRT), and conducting quality control assessments.

&#x20;Commissioner reports include data up to 100 years. The team inventoried all available reports across The team identified 2,790 reports, reviewed and digitized the data from 432 of them, and identified approximately 526 apparently missing reports, most from systems that were historically managed by the courts. There are 1,832 reports still requiring review.&#x20;

### Completed Systems Memorandums

* Sevier River
* Mill Creek (Moab)
* Duchesne River
* Castle Creek
* Huntington Creek



### **Challenges**

* Missing physical copies of CRs
* Illegible reports (hand writing)
* Sites changing names over the years (provide examples)
* Inconsistent CR formats from one system to another
* Current DVRT does not support version control ....we need HydroServer to fix and track outliers in CRs
