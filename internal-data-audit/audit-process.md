# Audit Process

The Data Review Team established a digitization and review procedure for measurement data, which evolved to accommodate the diversity of data issues and followed protocols which include these major steps: digitization, verification data entry; and visualization. The team summarizes common identified issues and results, which mainly include these categories: typographical errors, database data conflicts, outliers originating in the CR. The team also retrieved physical copies and scanned CR from archives or rescanned illegible reports.&#x20;
