# Matt Johnson

I am the Team Lead on the Water Right Network’s Colorado River team. I first started working for the Utah Division of Water Rights in August of 2024 as a Hydrologic Scientist working in Adjudication. I previously worked as an Environmental Geoscientist working with a consulting firm that helped with remediation at LUST sites.&#x20;

I received a bachelor’s degree in Applied Environmental Geoscience from Weber State University in 2017. While studying at Weber, I focused on water related courses, and also was part of a NSF funded internship program that matched undergraduate students with researchers at universities across Utah to study water related issues across the state, called iUTAH. I also received a GIS Certificate from the University of Alaska.

I grew up in New Hampshire and moved to Utah after high school to attend Weber State and to recreate in the gorgeous mountains of the Wasatch Front. I have always aspired to be involved with water related science and water resource management. I am excited and honored to be working with such a great team on this important water data modernization effort.<br>
