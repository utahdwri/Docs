# Lindsey Kaneko

I am the Team Lead on the Water Right Network’s Great Salt Lake team. I started with Water Rights in 2022 in Public Inquiry and joined the WRN team in 2023. I previously worked at the Grand America Hotels and Resorts.&#x20;

I studied physics at the University of Utah, earning a bachelor's degree in 2020. I interned with the Telescope Array Project, observing cosmic rays in the desert in Delta, UT. &#x20;

I grew up and still live in Salt Lake and I care deeply about my home. Working for Water Rights has given me a new perspective and understanding of the water issues in Utah. I love travelling around Utah, hiking and sightseeing, and aspire to go to every part of the state.
