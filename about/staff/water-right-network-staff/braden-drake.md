I have had the opportunity to work at the Division of Water Rights for nearly 3 years now. I started as an intern during the fall semester of 2022, and joined the Water Right Network team in 2023. This position was my first look into the white-collar world, as I was a teenager when I started. I have since graduated from the University of Utah with a Bachelors of Science in Urban Ecology. My experience here, combined with my education in Urban Planning has given me more context into how the two spheres interact.&#x20;

I am a Utah native, spending my childhood in Lehi and my teenage years in White City. Since 2022, I have called Salt Lake home. My family has had deep roots in Utah’s agricultural history, particularly in Midvale, Orem and Vernal. This work has given me a much better understanding of their lives. Outside of work I enjoy being active, including hiking, cycling, skateboarding, and weight lifting. I refuse to participate in any winter sports beyond sledding, though.
