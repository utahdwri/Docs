# Jacob Hurley

In March 2025, I joined the Utah Division of Water Rights as an engineer on the Water Right Network Team. Previously, I was a civilian engineer for the United States Navy in Washington State. In that role, I developed hydrology models, created in-house facility designs, provided construction support, managed design contracts, and handled multi-million dollar negotiations. I also participated in manufacturing equipment data initiatives and gap studies. These experiences prepared me for my current role which focuses on special projects for the water right network team such as performing large-scale cloud-based irrigation depletion calculations.

I graduated from the University of Utah in 2022 with a B.S. in Civil Engineering, focusing on water resources and environmental engineering. As an undergraduate, I gained practical experience through two internships and a part-time student engineering position, which were primarily focused on water resources and geotechnical engineering. I plan to continue my education by pursuing a graduate degree in the near future.

I am excited to apply my passion for water to the Division’s data modernization efforts. These efforts will bring a new level of accountability and auditability to a vital public resource. This role has also been a great opportunity to learn more about water use in Utah from the knowledgeable staff at the Division of Water Rights and the greater water user community.
