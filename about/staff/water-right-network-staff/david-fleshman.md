# David Fleshman

I joined the Division of Water Rights in 2024 as a Hydrologic Scientist on the Water Right Network team. I have always been passionate about water resources and aquatic ecology. Prior to working for the division, I spent four seasons leading ecological monitoring crews on rivers and streams in Utah and Nevada with the Bureau of Land Management. Before moving out west, my work experience was primarily in fisheries, working with the Iowa DNR and Iowa Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit. I earned a BS in Wildlife and Fisheries from Iowa State in 2018 and a MS in Biology from Missouri State in 2021. My thesis research was focused on aquatic invertebrate communities in streams in the Ozarks.

Outside of work, my interests include camping, rock climbing, concerts, reading, fishing, hiking, and attempting to photograph/identify every bug/plant/bird/fish/mammal/fungus I see.
