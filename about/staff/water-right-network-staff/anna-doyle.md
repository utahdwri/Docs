# Anna Doyle

I am the Water Right Network Program Manager in the Data Services Section of the Utah Division of Water Rights. I joined the Division of Water Rights in 2021 as an Assistant Regional Engineer in the Cedar City Regional Office, and then joined the Water Right Network Team in 2024. While working in the regional office I developed expertise in distribution, adjudication and supplemental group issues, which has helped me transition into my current role leading the Water Right Network team. Prior to joining the Division, I was an Environmental Education Volunteer for Peace Corps Mexico, where I worked in ecotourism, biointensive garden monitoring, and environmental science education.&#x20;

I earned a B.S. in Environmental Engineering and an M.Eng. in Water Resources Systems Engineering from Cornell University. In my undergraduate studies, I focused on sustainable drinking water treatment, and in my graduate studies, I focused on water resources engineering and hydrology. Working for the Division of Water Rights allows me to work on solving complex problems in a way that has a tangible impact in the State of Utah, and I find it rewarding to help the public better understand water issues and how they impact all of us.&#x20;

When I’m not thinking about the Duchesne Tunnel at 2am, I enjoy trail running, hiking with my dog, and staring into the void.
