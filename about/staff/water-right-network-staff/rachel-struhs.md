# Rachel Struhs

I started with the Division of Water Rights as a Hydrologic Scientist working on the Great Salt Lake team in August 2025. As a Utah native I am very passionate about the outdoors and caring for natural resources in the west. I graduated from the University of Utah in 2021 with a degree in Geography and an emphasis in Biogeography and Ecology and a minor in Anthropology. I also got my GIS certificate the following year. Prior to this position, I have worked for various government agencies including as the State of Utah floodplain intern in the Division of Emergency Management and as a GIS intern for the Public Lands Policy Coordinating Office. More recently, I spent the past 3 years as a GIS Specialist for the National Park Service in both the National Trails Office and for the Chihuahuan Desert Network. I have volunteered with the Utah Water Watch since high school taking stream measurements in Little Cottonwood Creek which has bolstered my interest in working with water in Utah. I have a passion for GIS and natural resources so working on the Water Rights Team is very exciting.&#x20;

Outside of work I love to read, cook, hike, camp, watch PBS mysteries, and do mini paintings.
