# John Briem

I have worked for the Division of Water Rights for nearly 19 years and have served in many capacities within the Utah Lake/Jordan River Regional office, Adjudication Section, and most recently as a Hydrologic Scientist with the Data Services Section. Our team is currently focused on tracking and mapping water conveyance systems within the Colorado River Basin in effort to better understand and defend Utah’s allotment of water awarded the State in the Colorado River Compact.

I graduated with a B.S. in Recreation Resource Management (glorified Environmental Studies) at Utah State University. I was born and raised in American Fork, Utah. My mother grew up on a dairy farm near Utah Lake where I spent countless hours weeding gardens, bailing hay, milking cows, and irrigating fields. My experiences there have given me a respect for farmers and the hard work that they do.&#x20;



Outside of work I enjoy gardening, disc golf, camping, and spending time with my wife and dog
