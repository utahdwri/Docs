# Cory Angeroth

Since July 2025, I have served as the Water Data Service Manager within the Utah Division of Water Rights, a role that integrates my interest in water data with my expertise in hydrology. My extensive background as a Hydrologist, specializing in water monitoring and data collection, provides me with a deep understanding of water systems and the importance of reliable data. My academic journey began at the University of Arizona, where I earned a degree in Hydrology and Water Resources, fostering my appreciation for the importance of water. My connection to water began in childhood, growing up on a Midwestern lake, and has since deepened through my many years in Utah, where I enjoy the state's diverse recreational opportunities.

\
I feel a profound responsibility to provide high-quality water data to all Utah residents and stakeholders. I have a strong commitment to the availability and accuracy and water data as I understand its importance to the well-being of the state. It is a privilege to contribute to this vital mission, ensuring present and future generations of Utahns have access to the information needed to make informed decisions about this precious resource.

\
When not in the office, I enjoy all manner of outdoor activities, from skiing in the winter to golfing in the summer with plenty of time on lakes and rivers mixed in!

My passion for large bodies of water comes from a childhood spent on the shore of Storm Lake, IA and a 2 year tour of the world’s oceans, courtesy of the United States Navy.
