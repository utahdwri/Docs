# Adam Phillips

Since June 2024, I have been a member of the Historical Distribution Data Audit Group, where I contribute to digitizing, verifying, and ensuring the quality of Utah’s historical water distribution data. I am a student at Utah Valley University, where I will graduate with a B.S. in Environmental Science and Management in Spring of 2026. In my free time I enjoy doing most anything in the mountains or in the desert, including hiking, camping, fishing, and dutch oven cooking. I also enjoy 3D design and 3D printing.

In my time at the division, I have developed database management skills that I use to ensure data is accurate and accessible to the public. It is my hope that my work will facilitate informed decisions, promoting the responsible and sustainable use of natural resources.
