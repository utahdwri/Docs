# Lily Clayton

Since the beginning of this year, I have been working with the data services team as a Engineering Technician I as a part of the Historical Distribution Data Audit Review Group. This group looks to digitize, verify, and evaluate and ensure the quality of the data. In working with the DWRi team it has shown me where we are in our effort in modernizing our data and how rewarding it is to be a part of this team seeing the progress we've made so far.&#x20;

Currently I am a student at SLCC and am looking to graduate in spring of 2027 with an Associates in Pre-Engineering with a focus in Environmental Civil Engineering then with that transfer to the University of Utah to continue my education. In my free time I like to create things like sewing, baking, and occasionally painting. My biggest hobby right now is baking sourdough and making sourdough discard recipes.&#x20;
