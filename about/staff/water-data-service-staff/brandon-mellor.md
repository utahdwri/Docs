# Brandon Mellor

I have worked with the Division of Water Rights for 10 years, and I currently serve as the Manager of the Water Use Program within the Division of Water Rights. In my role, I manage 1,560 water systems, which include Public Water Systems, Secondary Irrigation Systems, Industrial Water Systems and Management Plan Water Systems. I collaborate with the Division of Drinking Water,  the Division of Water Resources and USGS United States Geological Survey. My duties involve explaining, assisting with, and reviewing water use survey forms for Public Water Systems, Secondary Irrigation Systems, Industrial Water Systems and Management Plan Water Systems. I hold in-person and telephone meetings to facilitate this process. I coordinate with Caselle and Pelorus Methods, Inc., water accounting companies to help cities categorize connections into four categories: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Institutional. I also teach and give presentations on Utah Codes and Statutes regarding water use.

I earned my Associate's Degree in Computer Science, Physical Science, and Math from Salt Lake Community College. I also hold Safety Training Certificates from the College of Eastern Utah, as well as Water/Sewer Certificates and a Business Management Associate degree from Utah Valley University. In 2018, I was honored with the Community Outreach Award for DNR.

Working for the Division of Water Rights and the State of Utah in general is a great privilege. It means I get to utilize my extensive knowledge and experience in environmental research, project design, and management. It's a chance to contribute to the organization and supervision of facilities, and to establish and inspect safety standards. The role involves ensuring quality assurance and control. For the next generation, working for the Division offers a chance to make a real impact in a critical field, using skills in technology, science, and management to address important water resource challenges.
