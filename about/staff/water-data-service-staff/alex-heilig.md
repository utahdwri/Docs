# Alex Heilig

I am an Engineering Technician, part of the Water Data team in the Data Services section in the Division of Water Rights. I joined in February of 2025 and am working with the division on a user experience/interface project, using the software Figma. I have been designing mockups for a new, modernized tool that has the same functionalities as the many existing tools, while being more user-friendly. I have also been working with the Field Services team, traveling across the state to help them install water measurement devices that aim to improve water use data quality and accuracy.

I am currently a student at the University of Utah, pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering. I am expected to graduate in the fall of 2026. Some things I enjoy doing with my free time are working on/driving my project car, riding my motorcycle, and rock climbing.
