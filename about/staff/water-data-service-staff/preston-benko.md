# Preston Benko

I joined the Data Services team at the Utah Division of Water Rights in January 2025 as a Hydrologic Scientist. My primary focus is developing and implementing water distribution data QA/QC protocols and reviews for both historical records and current-year data. Aiding in establishing policies that define data quality objectives and standards, and outline procedures for automated validation, annotation, data cleaning, and data acceptance.

Before joining DWRi, I worked on developing and managing Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP/SWPPP) drawings, reports, and permit applications. I also served as a Watershed Scientist at Denver Water, where I performed and reviewed QA/QC protocols on water quality datasets. This effort helped identify and protect at-risk watersheds within Denver Water’s Collection and Management Systems.

I earned my B.S. from Colorado State University in 2021, where I conducted an independent study in Snow Hydrology with fellow undergraduates. We compared and displayed sublimation rates across various Northern Colorado land-use types. In 2017 we presented our findings at both the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Hydrology Days and the CSU Research & Engagement Symposium.

I grew up in Denver, Colorado, and recently moved to Salt Lake City for the incredible opportunity to work alongside the talented and dedicated team at the Division of Water Rights. Outside of work, my passions include hiking, backpacking, snowboarding, skateboarding, frisbee, and pretty much any sport that brings people together outside!

Working on this water data modernization effort means the world to me. I believe that taking a structured approach now will improve transparency, accountability, and data integrity, laying the foundation for greater resilience in times of drought and ensuring the environmental stewardship of our ecosystems. One of my biggest inspirations comes from my favorite engineer, Buckminster Fuller, who said:

“If humanity does not opt for integrity, we are through completely. It is absolutely touch and go. Each one of us could make a difference.”    &#x20;
