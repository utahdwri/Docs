# Angie Sizemore

I’m currently an Engineering Technician with the Historical Distribution Data Audit Review Team at the Division of Water Rights. I joined Water Rights in December 2021, and since then, it’s been incredibly rewarding to contribute to the ongoing effort to modernize and improve our data processes. I really enjoy working with data and being part of a well-rounded, collaborative team that’s made so much progress in just a few short years.

Before stepping into this role, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Utah and spent several years working as an Academic Advisor at various universities. Transitioning into this position was a big change career-wise, but it’s one I’ve truly enjoyed. The shift has allowed me to grow in new directions and develop skills that align with my passion for data and organization.

Outside of work, I stay busy with my energetic five-year-old son, Ryan, and our sweet goldendoodle. We love spending time outdoors—whether it’s walking, hiking, or camping. I’m also involved in animal rescue and find a lot of fulfillment in helping animals in need find safe, loving homes.
