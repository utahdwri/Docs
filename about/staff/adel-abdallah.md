# Adel Abdallah

I am the Interim Assistant State Engineer over Data Services at the Utah Division of Water Rights, where I lead the Water Data Service and Water Rights Network teams. I joined the Division in 2024 to help modernize water use data management efforts.

Previously, I served for five years as the Water Data Exchange (WaDE) Program Manager at the Western States Water Council, where I spearheaded the development of the Western States Water Access and Analysis Tool (WestDAAT)—a platform that streamlines access to and analysis of water rights and water use data across eighteen Western states. I am also the architect of the Western Water Conservation Application Tool (WestCAT) that integrates WestDAAT with OpenET to streamline voluntary, compensated, in-state, and temporary water conservation programs.

I earned my PhD in Civil and Environmental Engineering, with an emphasis in Hydroinformatics, from Utah State University (USU). I also hold an M.S. in Water and Energy Conservation from USU and a B.S. in Civil Engineering from An-Najah University in the West Bank, Palestine. I’m a [Certified Public Manager](https://cpmconsortium.org/What-is-a-Certified-Public-Manager) (CPM) (2021) and[ Scrum Master](https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-certified/scrum-master-track/certified-scrummaster) (2021).&#x20;

My approach to water data management emphasizes holistic use cases driven by user personas, along with user-centered design that balances technical expertise with practical, real-world solutions.

I’m excited to be working for the Division of Water Rights, where I can put my skills and education to use and make water data more transparent, accessible, and useful for everyone in Utah.

Outside of work, I try to keep up with my two sons, Kareem (10) and Waseem (5), on the soccer field. Beyond my passion for making sense of complex water data, I enjoy cooking Palestinian, Mexican, and Indian dishes, smoking salmon and occasionally briskets, baking sourdough, and pulling espresso shots.
