The Water Right Network (WRN) team has continued making steady progress and the initiative remains ‘In Process’, with significant advancements in both development methodology and basin-level implementation. The team has formalized and documented the WRN development process, created a training and outreach plan for internal staff, developed the WRN Action Plan, used a project-management software to manage tasks among team members, and built a dashboard to track WRN progress statewide.

In the Colorado River Basin, WRN development is complete for 21 of 37 WRN areas and two additional WRN areas are currently in development. The team worked closely with our Price and Vernal Regional Offices in verifying the WRN and arranging field visits with water users. The team has conducted 136 field visits with water users to verify the mapping of water-use infrastructure and gather feedback on the developed network. The team also developed a process to use OpenET consumptive-use data for the first depletion-accounting report for the Duchesne–Strawberry Distribution System. The team expects to complete the WRN for the Colorado River Basin in June 2026.

With new funding, in July 2025, the legislature established the Great Salt Lake Basin (GSLB) Water Right Network team by authorizing the hiring of two additional Hydrologic Scientists. The team expanded the scope of the WRN development to include groundwater and municipal/industrial use which are more prominent in the GSLB. The team also established a development priority work plan for all 23 WRN areas in the Basin. The team has completed the WRN for the Goshen/Juab area, with work underway in two additional areas. The team has conducted 11 field visits with water users to refine infrastructure understanding and gather feedback. Full development of the GSLB WRN is expected to take two to three years, with anticipated completion in December 2027.

Along with the WRN development, the team is implementing the outreach and training plan with targeted efforts to familiarize regional staff with the WRN. The team kicked off the training by visiting the Vernal and Price regional offices to introduce staff to the WRN. Beginning in November 2025, the team began holding monthly training sessions for a staff member from each of the Vernal and Price  Regional Offices. The team has scheduled training in January 2026 for the Utah Lake Regional Office. Broader awareness efforts also included presenting at two Duchesne Education Nights to reach community members, particularly water users.

Externally, multiple agencies and consultants have begun incorporating WRN data into their projects. The Colorado River Authority of Utah, in collaboration with Follum Engineering, is using the WRN geospatial dataset in the development of the Diversion Runoff Calculator (DRC), as documented in the CRAU FY 2026 Work Plan and an associated ASCE publication. Also, Precision Water Resources is applying the dataset in its Duchesne Basin model for the Central Utah Water Conservancy District. The Division of Water Resources is also leveraging the dataset in statewide planning and forecasting models. Collectively, these collaborations demonstrate the growing utility and relevance of the WRN to inform wider scope of management needs as it continues to mature into a foundational statewide data asset.

<summary><strong>Recommendation 1.3</strong>: Internal Data Audit </summary>

> 1.5 DWRi should continue its internal data audit to ensure it is accurate and> \
> complete and make improvements to the identified gaps or inaccuracies.

{% hint style="warning" %}
December 2025
{% endhint %}

The Data Services Section established a dedicated Water Data Review Team— currently composed of two Engineering Techs under the Water Data Service Manager—to continue the internal data audit.

\
In 2025, the Team undertook a comprehensive effort to digitize and review historical water-distribution data across all 43 distribution systems. This initiative included scanning any missing Annual Commissioner Reports (CRs) from the early 1900s through 2024, manually entering missing daily, monthly, and annual measurements into the Division’s Water Measurement Database (DVRT) from the CR’s, and conducting quality-control assessments. Each CR contains the water-measurement records for that year’s distribution season. When necessary, the Team also retrieved physical copies of reports from archives and rescanned pages when the previous scans were unreadable.

\
The Data Review Team established a standardized digitization and review procedure, which was refined over time to address the various data issues encountered. The protocol includes three major phases: digitization, verification of data entry (if needed), and data visualization. The Team documented recurring issues, which commonly fell into the following categories: typographical errors, database conflicts, and outliers originating from the CRs themselves.\
The Team completed the full review and digitization of the Sevier River Distribution System and most distribution systems within the Colorado River Basin, including Mill Creek (Moab), the Duchesne River, Huntington Creek, and the Price River. Active review and digitization are underway for the Ashley Creek and Brush Creek systems. For each system, the Team prepared a memo summarizing the audit results and shared it with regional staff, distribution engineers, and commissioners for their review and approval. These memos are uploaded to the corresponding system’s document repository in DVRT.

\
Additionally, the Team developed a dashboard to track and communicate progress across all distribution systems. Of the 2,790 CR’s, the Team has reviewed and digitized 432, and identified approximately 526 apparently missing reports—most from systems historically managed by the courts. A total of 1,832 reports still require review. Completion of the review and digitization effort is expected within 1.5 to 2 years depending on the number and availability of part-time Engineering Techs, with a target completion date of June 2027.<br>

<summary><strong>Recommendation 1.4</strong>: Water Use Program</summary>

> The Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Drinking Water should evaluate the resource needs of the Water Use Program and implement a new management strategy, based on best practices, that ensures that the Program can wholly achieve its goals. (Report Page 15)

{% hint style="warning" %}
December 2025
{% endhint %}

The Data Services Section launched a new management strategy for the Water Use Program by first strengthening and formalizing collaboration with the Division of Water Resources (DWRe) and the Division of Drinking Water (DDW), and by hiring a time-limited Hydrologic Scientist to support expanding data-collection and quality-control needs. Due to having just one-time funding, this position will only be able to assist for a limited time. On-going funding would be helpful to maintain and continue these efforts into the future.

The Water Use Program database is directly and routinely used by DWRe for statewide water-budget modeling and planning, and by DDW for water-source sizing standards. To improve and formalize coordination among the three agencies, the Data Services Section established an Inter-agency Water Use Data Management Committee to evaluate the Program and ensure alignment with the State Water Plan. Following the initial coordination meeting in December 2024, another meeting was held on November 17, 2025, to finalize committee membership. The committee agreed to meet monthly and to prepare a short briefing document outlining its goals. Initial goals include evaluating current data and metadata collection, summarizing statutes and rules related to water use, revising metadata, and assessing the overall scope of the Water Use Program. The next committee meeting is scheduled for January 2026.

As part of this collaboration, in March 2025, DWRi and DDW signed a Memorandum of Agreement to improve DWRi’s access to and integration with DDW water-system metadata. DDW subsequently created a new programmatic data-access endpoint that shares comprehensive water-system metadata with DWRi. In July 2025, DWRi created another programmatic data-access endpoint that provides DWRe with historical Water Use Program withdrawal data and metadata to support its water-supply reliability study.

The newly hired Hydrologic Scientist has already played a critical role in supporting the Program’s rapid expansion and assisting with data collection, review, and quality control. The number of reporting systems has increased substantially over the past decade—from 591 to 1,504. Last year, the Program collected data from 110 newly added systems and established 181 new systems that will report next year (see chart below).

The new Hydrologic Scientist also significantly accelerated the labor-intensive acquisition of service-area boundaries, completing the work several months ahead of schedule. He updated 183 system service-area boundaries, manually drawing 112 of them using an online updater. He also addressed 185 change applications that either established new systems or updated water rights for existing systems. In addition, he completed a detailed review of water-source locations and associated water rights for four counties: Juab, Piute, Millard, and Tooele.

In addressing a key audit recommendation, the new team member created the Water Use Database Data Dictionary, which documents metadata for all database fields and improves consistency and clarity in interpreting water-use information. To improve data quality, he also created a protocol to identify potential outliers and anomalies using simple statistical methods. He also conducted an intensive review of post-2015 water-use data and metadata using five newly developed interactive dashboards designed to visualize trends across space, time, and system categories. This review resolved long-standing issues, including correcting 147 erroneous withdrawal values and fixing the coordinates of 17 water sources. The review of pre-2015 data is expected to take another year.

To further assist DWRe, the Water Use Program enhanced the reporting tool to relate systems that change identifiers when transitioning between system types (for example, an industrial system becoming a secondary system), enabling parent-child tracking of systems over time. Finally, the Program developed mockups for a future modernized reporting tool that will include more robust validation checks and an improved user experience.

<summary><strong>Recommendation 1.5</strong>: Hydroinformatics Gaps &#x26; Technology Modernization </summary>

> The Division of Water Rights should improve internal data evaluation and management through the following: (Report Page 15)
>
> * Complete the gap analysis with Utah State University.
> * Link data to goals identified in the Division’s seven focus areas.
> * Create and update data tools, including a data map and data dictionary.&#x20;

Last year, in July 2024, the Division contracted with Utah State University (USU) to begin implementing the major components of the roadmap. As part of this effort, the Division adopted USU’s HydroServer database, which uses modern technology to manage time-series data and provides metadata structures that support consistent interpretation across the entire data lifecycle. HydroServer ensures unambiguous metadata handling, particularly as multiple users participate in quality-control activities. USU has created a data map and dictionary for the HydroServer database which describes how the data is related and what it means.\
\
In January 2025, the Data Services Section focused a modernization effort reviewing and quality-controlling distribution data. In February, the Section designed user-centered mockups for the future modernized dashboard tailored to the needs of various data users working with tasks related to the Division’s seven focus areas.

By May 2025, DWRi’s HydroServer staging environment was established for internal testing and for demonstrating data migration from the legacy system into the new platform.

In July 2025, the Division enhanced its contract with USU to include the design and deployment of an online quality-control tool that integrates with HydroServer to track edits, users, timestamps, and reasons for changes. Together, these systems create a more transparent, consistent, and auditable data-review process. To guide the transition and implementation, the Division developed an Operational Plan for HydroServer outlining the steps, roles, and responsibilities necessary to make HydroServer fully functional and aligned with legislative audit expectations.
